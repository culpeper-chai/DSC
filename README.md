My desktop setups for Unix-like systems.
NOTE: I have not sorted out the dependencies for any of this, so don't expect any of these scripts or configs to work out-of-the-box on your system (except possibly my Emacs config). This is just where I store my files so, if you use anything from this repository, you do so at your own risk; I'm not responsible for the consequences.
